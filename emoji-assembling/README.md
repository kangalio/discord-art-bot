# Emoji Assembling

This is a subproject with the aim of finding new sets of emojis to use for the discord art bot.

Please clone https://github.com/twitter/twemoji to twemoji/ and https://github.com/Necktrox/discord-emoji to discord-emoji/ for these scripts to work.

`twemoji/` is the Twitter Emoji icon set which Discord uses. `discord-emoji` is a Node.js repo containing mapping from Discord emoji shortcodes to the actual emojis. Both are required by these scripts.
